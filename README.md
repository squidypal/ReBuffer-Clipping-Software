### ReBuffer is INCOMPLETE - Meaning I do not reccomend using it as your daily clipping software

ReBuffer is an open source clipping software made in an attempt to capture the same ease of use as Medal.
ReBuffer has been put on halt while I focus on other things in my life, but I figured the code might as well be put out there.

## Features:
- Screen Clipping
- Audio Recording / Clipping
- Hotkey Clipping
- Adjustable Quality Settings
- Adjustable Directory
